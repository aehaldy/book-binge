This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# Book Binger
Start with a near-empty React (Next.js) project and end with a fully functional book search and list management system. This project uses the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to retrieve book data and cover images. The code-along teaches key React concepts like how to handle API calls, using TypeScript to type models and interfaces, and how to manage state and props. You will also practice conditional rendering and adding styles using SCSS, including responsive styling. Finally, the project teaches a very basic implementation of Next.js to create static pages, as well as using React-intl to localize your application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:4000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
