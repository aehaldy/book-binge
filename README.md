This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# Book Binge
Start with a near-empty React (Next.js) project and end with a book search and list management system. This project uses the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to retrieve book data and cover images. The code-along teaches key React concepts like how to handle API calls, using TypeScript to type models and interfaces, and how to manage state and props. You will also practice conditional rendering and adding styles using SCSS, including responsive styling. Finally, the project teaches a very basic implementation of Next.js to create static pages, as well as using React-intl to localize your application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
